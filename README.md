🧠 My DSA Practice Repository

This repository is my personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and solutions.
I’m using it to organize my practice, track progress, and revise concepts efficiently.

📁 Folder Structure

      250dsaquestions/
      │
      ├── Arrays/
      │
      └── README.md


Each folder contains:

📝 Problem statement

💡 Explanation / Approach

💻 Code (mostly in C++)

⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

🛠️ Language Used

Mainly C++, may add other languages later.

🎯 Purpose

     🗂️ Keep my solved DSA problems organized

     📈 Track learning and improvements

     🧩 Strengthen concepts before interviews and exams

🌱 Personal Notes

    ✅ Arrays started

    🚀 Will continue adding more problems regularly

⭐ A personal space to grow through consistency and logic.
